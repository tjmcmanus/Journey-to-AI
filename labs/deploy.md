# **[Deploy]{.smallcaps}** 

## Lab overview

*Note: This lab requires that you have completed Lab 06 Analyze:
AutoAI.*

In the previous lab, you created a model from both a notebook and from
AutoAI. You will learn how to Deploy these models in this lab.

In our scenario, Trade Co. uses these steps to deploy their machine
learning models into production.

## Persona represented in this lab

The Developer persona is the likely role to perform the various Deploy
tasks in this lab. However, the Data Scientist persona could perform
these tasks as well.

## Logging into the CPD web client (if you have not already done so)

1.  If you are starting this lab stand-alone (without going through
    previous labs) do the following:

2.  Double-click the desktop icon: Cloud Pak for Data Web Client.

height="0.7958748906386701in"}

3.  The CPD web client GUI displays as shown. Use cpduser and cpdaccess
    for the *Username* and *Password* and click Sign in.

## Reviewing the notebook deployment space

Think of model deployment as the equivalent of writing a self-service
application that takes the model and makes it available through a REST
API interface. Application developers access and consume the model
through the same interface. While this is a manual process in most
organizations, Cloud Pak for Data can automate deploying and maintaining
models without writing a single line of code.

CPD eliminates the need for to do the following:

-   Writing code to perform the above capability and using a runtime to
    deploy it.

-   Creating a runtime on bare metal machines that require OS
    installation, network, storage, etc.

-   Creating a runtime on a virtual machine in VMware on Intel, or IBM
    POWER VMÂ® on a POWER platform.

-   Creating a runtime in Docker or CRI-O requires someone to build the
    image and deploy it on one of the above platforms.

Each of the above requires manpower and machine resources. Using CPD,
you can bypass this and quickly harvest insight from your data in a
repetitive manner by integrating it with your CI/CD pipeline.

### **Associating a deployment space**

## Lab conclusion

Today, organizations need better, faster and more integrated methods for
model deployment that can include online, batch and virtual testing. The
Cloud Pak for Data deploy capabilities help serve this need so they can
more easily infuse AI into their applications.

In our scenario, the Trade Co. developer used the platform to easily
deploy and test models.

# **[Deploy]{.smallcaps}**  {#deploy}

## Lab overview {#lab-overview}

*Note: This lab requires that you have completed Lab 06 Analyze:
AutoAI.*

In the previous lab, you created a model from both a notebook and from
AutoAI. You will learn how to Deploy these models in this lab.

In our scenario, Trade Co. uses these steps to deploy their machine
learning models into production.

## Persona represented in this lab {#persona-represented-in-this-lab}

The Developer persona is the likely role to perform the various Deploy
tasks in this lab. However, the Data Scientist persona could perform
these tasks as well.

## Logging into the CPD web client (if you have not already done so) {#logging-into-the-cpd-web-client-if-you-have-not-already-done-so}

1.  If you are starting this lab stand-alone (without going through
    previous labs) do the following:

2.  Double-click the desktop icon: Cloud Pak for Data Web Client.

![A picture containing object, clock Description automatically

height="0.7958748906386701in"}

3.  The CPD web client GUI displays as shown. Use cpduser and cpdaccess
    for the *Username* and *Password* and click Sign in.

height="2.0904811898512685in"}

## Reviewing the notebook deployment space {#reviewing-the-notebook-deployment-space}

Think of model deployment as the equivalent of writing a self-service
application that takes the model and makes it available through a REST
API interface. Application developers access and consume the model
through the same interface. While this is a manual process in most
organizations, Cloud Pak for Data can automate deploying and maintaining
models without writing a single line of code.

CPD eliminates the need for to do the following:

-   Writing code to perform the above capability and using a runtime to
    deploy it.

-   Creating a runtime on bare metal machines that require OS
    installation, network, storage, etc.

-   Creating a runtime on a virtual machine in VMware on Intel, or IBM
    POWER VMÂ® on a POWER platform.

-   Creating a runtime in Docker or CRI-O requires someone to build the
    image and deploy it on one of the above platforms.

Each of the above requires manpower and machine resources. Using CPD,
you can bypass this and quickly harvest insight from your data in a
repetitive manner by integrating it with your CI/CD pipeline.

## Lab conclusion {#lab-conclusion}

Today, organizations need better, faster and more integrated methods for
model deployment that can include online, batch and virtual testing. The
Cloud Pak for Data deploy capabilities help serve this need so they can
more easily infuse AI into their applications.

In our scenario, the Trade Co. developer used the platform to easily
deploy and test models.
