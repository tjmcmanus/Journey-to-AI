# **[Infuse: Cognos Analytics - Introduction]{.smallcaps}**

## Lab overview

In this lab, we will upload a CSV file given to us by our IT department
to see if there is any interesting information and if we can use this
information to better target market our potential high-risk churn
customers.

For this lab, we will use the power of the IBM Cloud Pak for Data
platform and the IBM Cognos Analytics cartridge. Installation of the IBM
Cognos Analytics cartridge has already been done for you.

## Persona represented in this lab

For this lab, we will assume the roles of both a Data Engineer and a
Business Analyst.

    height="1.3166655730533683in"}

14. In the Recent area, in the upper left corner of the CustomerChurn
    CSV card, select ellipses Create exploration.

    ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
    generated](/Users/tjm/Documents/GitHub/CPD-workshop/labs/images/media/image13.png){width="3.9454363517060367in"
    height="2.074981408573928in"}

## Cleaning up the data

When IBM Cognos Analytics imports CSV files, it does its best to
understand the data type, usage and aggregation from reading your data.
Depending upon the data you import, you may need to help IBM Cognos
Analytics out by defining some data properties.

15. From the left-hand menu, select the icon for the Data tab.

    ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
    generated](/Users/tjm/Documents/GitHub/CPD-workshop/labs/images/media/image14.png){width="1.9333333333333333in"
    height="2.042253937007874in"}

    Note: You will notice icons next to each field showing a
    representation of the data items usage as recognized by IBM Cognos
    Analytics. Measures are represented by a ruler, numeric values as a
    hash, text values as ABC, time values as a clock and geographic
    points as a pin.

16. Because this data is a snapshot total of values for a given date,
    you will need to change the aggregation properties of your measures,
    so they roll up correctly and do not give you misleading or false
    information.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| ![](/Users/tjm/Documents         | TIP: If you cannot read the full |
| /GitHub/CPD-workshop/labs/images | name of the data item shown on   |
| /media/image1.png){width="0.4in" | your screen, simply hover over   |
| height="0.4in"}                  | the name and a fly out will      |
|                                  | display the full name. Another   |
| Business Analyst                 | option is to use the zoom out    |
|                                  | feature of your browser.         |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

17. For the following measures, change the Properties of the Data Item
    by selecting the ellipses at the end of each item and choosing
    Properties from the menu.

    For example, the following displays the properties for Average
    Dollar per Unit traded:

    ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
    generated](/Users/tjm/Documents/GitHub/CPD-workshop/labs/images/media/image15.png){width="3.9255435258092737in"
    height="3.752380796150481in"}

18. You will be presented with the Properties of that measure.

    Change the Aggregate of Average Dollar per Unit traded measure to
    None, then Close.

    ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
    generated](/Users/tjm/Documents/GitHub/CPD-workshop/labs/images/media/image16.png){width="4.670431977252844in"
    height="2.8285717410323707in"}

19. Change the other Data Items with the following property values by
    following the previous steps.

  **Data Item**                    **Usage**   **Aggregate**
  -------------------------------- ----------- ----------------
  Average Dollar per Unit traded   Measure     None
  Net realized gains YTD           Measure     None
  Net realized losses YTD          Measure     None
  Days since last login            Attribute   Count Distinct
  Days since last trade            Attribute   Count Distinct
  Age                              Attribute   Count Distinct
  Children                         Attribute   Count Distinct
  Estimated Income                 Attribute   None

20. Because there are a lot of Estimated Income values, it would be
    better to group this data in buckets for easier understanding.

    By Estimated income, select ellipses Create data group.

    ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
    generated](/Users/tjm/Documents/GitHub/CPD-workshop/labs/images/media/image17.png){width="3.1480653980752407in"
    height="2.0571423884514437in"}

21. Choose Create a data group (numeric style).

    ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically

    height="1.6292596237970254in"}

22. You will be presented with the following auto grouping:

    ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically

    height="3.393099300087489in"}\
    *Note: You could manually enter group values or use Cognos to
    automatically do it for you!*

24. Select Create.

    You will notice you have created a new grouping at the top of your
    Data Items list.

25. When you are finished, return to the Exploration canvas by selecting
    the Exploration tab.

    ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically

    height="1.6078455818022748in"}

    IBM Cognos Analytics Exploration asks you: Where do you want to
    start?

    You can see that IBM Cognos Analytics suggests starting with some of
    the measures it found in your Data Module. This is helpful in
    discovering what are the possible drivers behind each of your
    metrics. IBM Cognos Analytics uses a powerful AI engine to assist
    you in discovering possible drivers between measures and dimensions,
    strength of relationships between dimensions, and also possible ways
    of examining this data for you by suggesting highly visual graphs of
    this data by dimension.

    When IBM Cognos Analytics suggests: Try starting with one of
    these... it is providing you an easy way to begin discovering and
    exploring what it finds as potentially important (what is driving
    our metrics?) based on a measure or dimension.

    We are not limited to these options, though.

26. Select the area where it asks you to Enter data column and you will
    see that all of your Data Module Data Items are presented.

## Exploring Data Relationships

For this workshop, let's have IBM Cognos Analytics help us understand
our customers better from this data set.

Let's first find out which customers are spending the most on trades
with us.

27. From the dropdown, type Churn, then select Churn Risk.

    ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
    generated](/Users/tjm/Documents/GitHub/CPD-workshop/labs/images/media/image25.png){width="4.209523184601925in"
    height="2.8346008311461066in"}

28. By hovering over each of my measures associated with Churn Risk, I
    can get a quick understanding of relationship strength that is
    driving Churn Risk.

    ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
    generated](/Users/tjm/Documents/GitHub/CPD-workshop/labs/images/media/image26.png){width="5.117020997375328in"
    height="3.845272309711286in"}

> For example, there seems to be a 73% relationship strength between Net
> realized losses YTD and Churn Risk.

29. Hover over other measures to see how they relate as well.

> You can see that IBM Cognos Analytics has selected the scope of fields
> to show relationship strength between. You are not limited to this,
> however. You can change the scope of this relationship examination to
> remove fields that you know may interfere with getting a proper
> result.

30. Select the drop-down menu to Edit diagram and select Edit scope.

    ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
    generated](/Users/tjm/Documents/GitHub/CPD-workshop/labs/images/media/image27.png){width="2.131932414698163in"
    height="1.6857141294838145in"}

    Fields such as DOB, Longitude and Latitude are probably Data Items
    that do not bring any value when examining your data relationships
    and [may cause static]{.ul} when exploring your data.

31. You can remove those by hovering over, then selecting the
    ![](/Users/tjm/Documents/GitHub/CPD-workshop/labs/images/media/image28.png){width="0.20699037620297464in"
    height="0.19444444444444445in"} next to DOB, Longitude and Latitude,
    then OK.

    height="3.2761909448818898in"}

## Creating Exploration Cards

When IBM Cognos Analytics examines relationships, the powerful AI engine
will begin to surface charts and graphs that may be of interest to you.
This is especially helpful if you are unfamiliar with the data you are
working with.

Scroll down on the far-right portion of your screen, then notice that
IBM Cognos Analytics has presented you with three visualizations. You
can begin with one of these info graphs or 'Cards' or see more Cards.

34. Select link See more.

    height="3.922253937007874in"}

60. That looks really noisy! Let's now group that Total dollar value
    traded. Lucky for us, IBM Cognos Analytics allows you to Auto-group
    on the fly.

    Select the ellipses next to Total dollar traded Auto-group.

    ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically

    height="2.754861111111111in"}

    IBM Cognos Analytics Assistant created a dashboard for you!

65. You can investigate this dashboard by selecting the tabs at the top
    or hover over any of the charts and graphs. We wish to focus in on
    our high churn customers. So, let's filter this dashboard.

    From the Data tab ![A picture containing drawing Description
    automatically
    generated](/Users/tjm/Documents/GitHub/CPD-workshop/labs/images/media/image51.png){width="0.4571434820647419in"

## Embedding Cognos Content

68. Now that you have created and saved your dashboard, you can Share
    your information to others. There are two options when sharing a
    link. You can either provide an HTML link to your dashboard or you
    can view the embedded code. You can also export your dashboard to a
    PDF file. To view all these options, choose the Share button at the
    top left.

## Lab conclusion

The results of this Exploration and Dashboard give us a good
understanding of our high churn risk customers, how much they spend and
where they are located. I can make marketing decisions in these areas to
ensure my business is not at risk of losing these customers.

You have now witnessed the ease at which IBM Cognos Analytics can create
highly visual dashboards for greater business insight...all without need
to code any expressions in a secure, governed manner.

You're off to a good start. Keep in mind, IBM Cognos Analytics offers
insight and infused AI using several governed, easy to use components.
Through this lab, you have experienced working with Data Modules,
Explorations and Dashboards. But IBM Cognos Analytics offers other areas
of insight as well, such as Reports and other areas of analysis that
could not fit in this lab.

We encourage you to delve deeper into all these other avenues of insight
by taking on other online IBM Cognos Analytics workshops available to
you.
