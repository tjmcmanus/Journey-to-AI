## IBM Journey to Cloud and AI: Analytics Modernization Workshop

This workshop provides hands-on experience with Cloud Pak for Data that will show you how to modernize your microservices applications by enriching them with Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The Journey to AI requires a strong information architecture (IA) that supports self-service capabilities and balances the needs of both the agility required by lines of business as well as the "Enterprise class" delivery required by IT. This journey can move significantly faster and with more efficiency when you use a single integrated platform like Cloud Pak for Data. It is the world's leading platform that allows you to Collect, Organize and Analyze data, and then Deploy the results to Infuse your applications with AI.

## Cloud Pak for Data: defined

Cloud Pak for Data (CPD) is an integrated end-to-end data and analytics platform designed to help make data more accessible and trusted, as well as to provide access to many analytical tools to help your organization gain insights from your data.

CPD provides the data platform that accelerates the journey up the "AI Ladder." With it, you can quickly build, train, deploy, and manage machine learning (ML) models to create applications with Artificial intelligence (AI). CPD provides inventory and cataloging of your data sources, self-service shopping for data, and data integration and refinement capabilities. Thus, high quality and trusted data can be more easily prepared, assembled and used in one modern, integrated, collaborative and scalable platform.

Cloud Pak for Data is installed on the foundation of OpenShift for the cluster this workshop uses.

## OpenShift: defined

[Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/)Â is an open, hybrid cloud Kubernetes platform used to build, run, and scale container-based applications. OpenShift itself is built upon a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. OpenShift includes everything you need to manage your development lifecycle, including standardized workflows, support for multiple environments, continuous integration, and release management.

Cloud Pak for Data can be installed and managed on public cloud platforms as well, including IBM Cloud, AWS, Microsoft and more.

## Lab workshop environment

> We are using a CPD cloud cluster for this workshop. This software environment was built with the following key software components:

-   Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) 4.5 as the foundational cloud-native technology platform of Kubernetes and Docker, as well as other open-source tools.

-   Cloud Pak for Data v3.5.2 as the microservice-built, integrated data and analytics platform with various add-ons installed and enabled.

## Getting started

1. To launch your CPD cluster,
1. The CPD web client GUI displays as shown below.
   Use cpduser and cpdaccess for the *Username* and *Password* and click Sign in.
    ![image](./images/media/image16.png)
1. You should now be at the Home Page.
    ![](./images/media/image17.png)
1. Scroll down to review the quick navigation and resources links on this page. You will be exploring many of these in more detail in this workshop, so don't follow these links right now.
   ![](./images/media/image18.png)
1. If you do happen leave this page by clicking on a link and you want to return to it, you can do so by clicking:
  - Navigation Menu ("hamburger" icon)
  - Home ![image](./images/media/image19.png) ![image](./images/media/image20.png)
1. You can, of course, also use the browser back and forward arrow keys to navigate through main screens in the CPD web client.

   | **Persona** | **Capabilities** |
   | :---: | :--- |
   | ![](./images/media/image10.png) Admin | In this workshop, we will demonstrate the Collect, Organize and Analyze capabilities to create a machine learning model that you can Deploy and then Infuse into a microservices application.<br/> CPD is very much "persona driven" in that each user can play their particular part in your organization's journey to AI. Each user can hand off and/or share their work with other users/personas, for a totally collaborative environment. |
1. Click back to the Users section and then click on Configure LDAP. You can review the fields required to do this here.
