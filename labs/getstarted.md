## IBM Journey to Cloud and AI: Analytics Modernization Workshop

This workshop provides hands-on experience with Cloud Pak for Data that
will show you how to modernize your microservices applications by
enriching them with Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence
(AI).

The Journey to AI requires a strong information architecture (IA) that
supports self-service capabilities and balances the needs of both the
agility required by lines of business as well as the "Enterprise class"
delivery required by IT. This journey can move significantly faster and
with more efficiency when you use a single integrated platform like
Cloud Pak for Data. It is the world's leading platform that allows you
to Collect, Organize and Analyze data, and then Deploy the results to
Infuse your applications with AI.

## Cloud Pak for Data: defined

Cloud Pak for Data (CPD) is an integrated end-to-end data and analytics
platform designed to help make data more accessible and trusted, as well
as to provide access to many analytical tools to help your organization
gain insights from your data.

CPD provides the data platform that accelerates the journey up the "AI
Ladder." With it, you can quickly build, train, deploy, and manage
machine learning (ML) models to create applications with Artificial
intelligence (AI). CPD provides inventory and cataloging of your data
sources, self-service shopping for data, and data integration and
refinement capabilities. Thus, high quality and trusted data can be more
easily prepared, assembled and used in one modern, integrated,
collaborative and scalable platform.

Cloud Pak for Data is installed on the foundation of OpenShift for the
cluster this workshop uses.

## OpenShift: defined

[Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/)Â is an open, hybrid cloud
Kubernetes platform used to build, run, and scale container-based
applications. OpenShift itself is built upon a foundation of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux. OpenShift includes everything you need to manage your
development lifecycle, including standardized workflows, support for
multiple environments, continuous integration, and release management.

Cloud Pak for Data can be installed and managed on public cloud
platforms as well, including IBM Cloud, AWS, Microsoft and more.

## Lab workshop environment

> We are using a CPD cloud cluster for this workshop. This software
> environment was built with the following key software components:

-   Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) 4.3.21 as the
    > foundational cloud-native technology platform of Kubernetes and
    > Docker, as well as other open-source tools.

-   Cloud Pak for Data v3.0.1 as the microservice-built, integrated data
    > and analytics platform with various add-ons installed and enabled.

## Audience for this IBM workshop

This IBM workshop is aimed at the line-of-business professionals who are
tasked to gain new insights from all available data -- regardless of its
type and origin. The following personas who will be represented in the
various labs will greatly benefit from this workshop:

## Getting started

1.  To launch your CPD cluster, you will select the virtual machine with
    the label Master1.

Click on this node (VM) to expand the image and then click on the
display option in the top bar and select Fullscreen.

![](/Users/tjm/Documents/GitHub/CPD-workshop/labs/images/media/image8.png){width="1.875in"

height="1.2446741032370954in"}

You are now in the first (headed) virtual machine image of a cluster of
virtual machines that comprise your Cloud Pak for Data cluster.
Everything you will be doing in the labs will be driven from this first
image.

19. The next screen shows the underlying OpenShift/Kubernetes pods for
    this deployment. (Your pod names will differ.)

21. Click on tab Service Instances.

This shows how many instances of the Db2 Advanced Edition have been
created using the Db2 Advanced Edition deployment. In our case, it is
only one.

We will review this instance in a different way later in this lab.

## Reviewing the profile settings 

22. Click the top right circle of your web client screen that has your
    user icon on it. This provides a drop down.

Choose Profile and settings.

(Note: this is also the location where you can Log out of the web
client)

height="2.112325021872266in"}

23. Review the things you can change in your Profile, then review
    Permissions.

Note: in Permissions, your user has all permissions to allow you to do
anything required in the workshop lab exercises. In the real world, your
permissions would be more limited and controlled by an administrator.

24. Now review Git Integrations Generate API key and New token.

These allow you to configure Git with CPD, which allows you to integrate
CPD projects with your current CI/CD (Continuous Integration and
Continuous Delivery) pipeline to automate delivery of the artifacts you
create in the CPD platform. You can use the capabilities from the
underlying OpenShift platform to build cloud native microservice
applications which are tied to the ML / AI model development with a
delivery pipeline.

## Reviewing CPD services

25. Click the Services icon (four little squares over one bigger square)
    on the top right corner of your screen.

![A screen shot of a person Description automatically

height="0.8357502187226596in"}

26. This will bring up all available services for Cloud Pak for Data.

Click through the various categories to see what services you can
install on CPD.

For example, click on category AI and notice what is available there.
Those with "Enabled" are accessible by this CPD cluster right now.

height="2.670774278215223in"}

27. Now, click on the Watson Machine Learning service tile to get more
    details on what this service can do.

28. Click the browser back arrow to return to the Services catalog
    screen.

(Or you can click on the Services catalog link in the breadcrumb trail
itself)

> height="0.9607305336832895in"}

29. Another convenient way to review these Services is to filter them in
    the Services Catalog options.

Click through Pricing, Source and Status.

In Status, check Enabled

30. This will show all the enabled services in your cluster (as long as
    you did not check a filter for Categories, Pricing or Source.)

## Lab conclusion

Cloud Pak for Data is useful in the following business macro use-case
scenarios:

1.  **Manage Your Data Anywhere**: Use data virtualization, streaming,
    cataloging, governance and more to prepare your data for analysis.

2.  **Operationalize Data Science & AI**: Build, deploy, manage & govern
    models and data at scale to improve business outcomes like
    controlling customer churn, cross selling and up selling, predictive
    maintenance and more.

3.  **Shift to Next-Gen workloads**: Shift to Cloud Native to be able to
    provision and scale in minutes, build once and deploy anywhere with
    multi-cloud support, and use built-in automation and collaboration
    to increase productivity.

4.  **Smarter Governance:** Enable self-service analytics with
    auto-discovery of meta data, implementing governance rules and
    policies, enforcement of privacy to mitigate risk and to ensure
    compliance for regulatory requirements like GDPR.

height="1.2013888888888888in"}

Make Cloud Pak for Data your platform for data and analytics. Why?
Because IBM understands data and provides an integrated, end-to-end data
platform that enables enterprises to:

-   Collect relevant data and make it simple and accessible

-   Use federation, virtualization and/or transformation to combine and
    refine data sets

-   Organize data so it can be trusted

-   Analyze insights on demand

-   Infuse machine learning into your applications

All of the above and much more will be demonstrated in the following
workshop labs.
